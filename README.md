🚀 The "Project Originality" Checker 🚀
Welcome to the most groundbreaking, revolutionary, and paradigm-shifting software ever conceived in a university computer lab. This tool is single-handedly designed to solve the age-old problem of students maybe reusing old project ideas.

We're basically superheroes, but for syllabus integrity. Please, hold your applause.

🎯 Our Lofty Goal 🎯
The aim of this project is as simple as it is noble: to gently prevent the time-honored academic tradition of submitting last year's project with a new title. By creating a sophisticated digital archive of past glories, we can ensure that every student has the unique opportunity to experience the thrill of starting from scratch. You're welcome.

🧠 Installation (For Geniuses Only) 🧠
If you wish to wield this immense power, you must follow these incredibly complex steps. Try to keep up.

Acquire a "Computer". This is a non-negotiable prerequisite. We're not miracle workers.

Install "Python". It's some kind of snake-themed programming language. Apparently, it's popular.

Create a Virtual Environment. We're told this is important. It's like a little digital terrarium for your project so it doesn't get its feelings hurt by your other code.

Run the Ancient Incantation. Open a terminal and whisper the following magic words. Do not shout them, or you'll scare the machine spirits.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Provide Secret Keys. You'll need to create a .env file and put your database URL in it. If you don't know what that is, you've already failed the test.

Usage
To witness the spectacle, run the following command. But be warned: what you see may change your life forever.

python view_projects.py

If a list of projects appears, congratulations. You have successfully operated a complex piece of software. If not... well, have you tried turning it off and on again?

Disclaimer: This tool might not actually solve plagiarism, but it does run without crashing (usually). And isn't that what really matters?

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
