# 🧠 trueProject  
*Because originality deserves a fair chance (for once).*

---

### 💡 What is this?  
`trueProject` is a tongue-in-cheek initiative to ensure every student’s “new” idea is actually new.  
It’s a digital guardian that spots recycled academic projects before they get a second life — or a new title.  

Basically:  
> If last year’s code is this year’s innovation, trueProject will know. 👀

### ⚙️ Status  
Still cooking in the lab — not ready for the spotlight (yet).

### 🪄 Motto  
> “Making originality cool again — one suspicious project at a time.”
